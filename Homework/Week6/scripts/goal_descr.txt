The power of linked views, in my opinion, is trying to show data where different elements
influence each other. That is why the choices above where made. You can't easily express
happiness in just one number, bar or any other graph. People who live isolated have a greater
chance of dying earlier and (not all) are less happy, even your level of education 
has influence on these elements. The value of the linked views is by selecting interesting 
couples in the scatterplot or button-group and comparing them on different aspects of happiness and life 
(but still keeping it informative).
